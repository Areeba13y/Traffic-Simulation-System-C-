# Traffic-Simulation-System-C-

This is a basic traffic simulation system that mimics the operation of traffic lights and vehicle movement at a four-way intersection (North, South, East, West).

# Features

- Simulates a 4-way intersection with traffic lights.
- Random vehicles are generated and placed on different lanes.
- Each lane has a signal that alternates between GREEN and RED.
